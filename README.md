# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. I manage them with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

Some of the tools I manage with these config files are:
- neovim, a powerful fully-featured IDE that runs in the terminal. I used [LazyVim](http://www.lazyvim.org/) and am very happy with its ease of use and documentation.
- kanshi, which I used in combination with the EndeavourOS Sway starter setup to manage external displays on my laptop.
- gitui and lazygit. I initially used gitui, but due to a problem with SSH keys, I moved to lazygit, which I have been using with completely default setup so far.
- zsh with a simple oh-my-zsh config
