# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. I manage them with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

Some of the tools I manage with these config files are:
- neovim, a powerful fully-featured IDE that runs in the terminal. I use a very close to vanilla [LazyVim](http://www.lazyvim.org/) and am very happy with its ease of use and documentation
- [kanshi](https://git.sr.ht/~emersion/kanshi), which I used in combination with [SwayWM](https://swaywm.org/) to manage external displays on my laptop.
- [gitui](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui) and [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit). I initially used gitui, but due to a problem with SSH keys, I moved to lazygit, which I have been using with completely default setup so far.
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki). I customised some bindings to harmonize them with LazyVim and added a tokyo-night theme using Tmux Plugin Manager
- zsh with a simple [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) config
